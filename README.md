      <td> This task required the bot to find the IR light emitting tower. <br> The IR beacon tower is emitting light at a certain frequency which the bot detects                using an amplification circuit and moves towards it. The circuit designed works over a distance upto 5 mts. For more details, please refer to the report. </td>
